# CleanMail Tool 🧼📧

A lightweight but effective utility designed to take raw, often messy email content and turn it into something clean, structured, and human-readable.

---

## ✨ Overview

While working with automated emails or scraping email data, I noticed how unformatted and hard-to-read the content can get — filled with `%20`, `\n`, extra white space, and broken lines. CleanMail Tool was built to handle exactly that.

The tool takes messy email data as input, formats it for readability, and (bonus!) automatically copies the result to your clipboard — so it's ready to paste wherever you need.
